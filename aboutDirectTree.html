        <h2>
          <i>DirectTree</i> is a software application which which analyzes disk drives, identifying it's most storage consuming sectors.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          The user-selected drive is scanned and stored in a Tree abstract data type (ADT), and once scanning is complete the user can traverse the drive and it's sub-directories.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          With each traversal, a color-coded bar legend shows the most storage consuming items in the sub-directory, with the sections in the bar-legend split proportionally to item size.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          The application's code and interface were created using the Qt C++ cross-platform framework, and the program is currently built for Windows OS.
