        <h1>FILTERPLOT</h1>
        <h2>
          <i>FILTERPLOT</i> is a software application which performs synthsis, simulation, and optimization of 2 port microwave filter networks.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          The application has a number of menus which offer easy user interaction as well as options to input and output data files.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          The application's code and interface was developed using MATLAB for the Centre of Integrated RF Engineering at the University of Waterloo.

          <h2>SYNTHESIS</h2>
          <p>
            The app's synthesis tab takes user input for filter parameters, and in turn synthesizes the filter's coupling matrix.
            The coupling matrix menu is interchangeable with the synthesis, simulation and optimization menus, so the user can work
            with/change their synthesis results in the other menus.

        <div class="app-desc">
          <h2>SIMULATION</h2>
          <p>
            The app's simulation menu takes in user input for filter parametes as well as the coupling matrix, and in turn simulates the filter's 
            scattering parameters. The user can manually enter all of this information, but alternatively they can import an input data file
            (in the form of an Excel Spreadsheet) containing the required information.

      <!-- Optimization Menu -->

        <div class="app-desc">
          <h2>OPTIMIZATION</h2>
          <p>
            The app's optimization menu takes results from either the synthesis or simulation menus, and optimizes the filter's
            coupling matrix. The user can choose between optimizing towards their own specifications, or optimizing towards a data file response, and a dropdown gives
             the user a selection of MATLAB built-in optimization functions.
